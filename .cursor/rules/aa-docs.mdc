description: Requires comprehensive documentation for all features and changes.
alwaysApply: true

- Create detailed implementation documents in the docs folder for all new features and major changes.
- Implementation docs should include:
  - Overview and purpose
  - Technical design and architecture
  - Dependencies and requirements
  - Implementation details and code examples
  - Configuration and setup instructions
  - Testing approach and considerations
  - Security implications if applicable
  - Performance considerations
  - Migration steps if needed
- Update enhancements.md to track feature additions and improvements.
- Maintain clear and organized documentation structure in the docs folder.
- Include API documentation for public interfaces.
- Document configuration options and environment variables.
- Add usage examples and common scenarios.
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes.
- Review and update existing documentation when making related changes.
- Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date with all completed features, bug fixes, and changes.
- Use enhancements.md only for tracking planned or in-progress enhancements and features.
- When an enhancement or feature is completed, summarize it and move the entry from enhancements.md to CHANGELOG.md.
- Ensure that enhancements.md reflects only current and future work, not completed items.
- Regularly review and reconcile enhancements.md and CHANGELOG.md to maintain accuracy and clarity in project history.
 - Documentation generation is required and must block PR merges: generate HTML via pdoc to `docs/api` and Markdown via pydoc-markdown to `docs/api_markdown`.
    - this has been automated using the scripts/build_api_docs.py script
 - Docstring standards: Google-style docstrings for all modules, classes, methods, and functions with types, returns, raises, and examples where helpful.
 - Keep API docs synchronized with code: update docstrings when signatures change; document breaking changes and deprecations; version docs alongside code.
 - Run documentation generation in CI on every PR and on merge to main. PRs must include links to updated docs in the PR body.
 - Implementation docs are required when a feature/fix is complex enough to warrant one; link them from the PR and `docs/README.md`.
