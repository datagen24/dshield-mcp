description: Use of GitHub CLI for managing PR's

- When creating pull requests with the GitHub CLI, always generate a temporary Markdown-formatted file for the PR body.
- Use the `--body-file` option with `gh pr create` to supply the PR body, ensuring proper formatting and avoiding shell escaping issues.
- Do not use inline `--body` arguments for PR creation; always prefer the file-based approach for clarity and reliability.
- Example workflow:
  - Write the PR description to a temporary file (e.g., `.pr-body.md`).
  - Run: `gh pr create --body-file .pr-body.md [other options]`
  - Always remove the temporary file after PR creation.
- This approach ensures consistent, readable PR descriptions and prevents issues with special characters or formatting in shell commands.
 - Discover available labels with `gh label list` and apply appropriate labels to the PR / issue.
 - Validate the linked issue exists using `gh issue view <id>`; reference the issue in the PR title/body.
 - PR body should include: Summary, Changes, Tests, Documentation updates, Security considerations, and Snyk results summary.
 - Draft PRs are encouraged for WIP. Convert to Ready for Review when all required checks pass locally.
 - If DCO is enabled for the repository, include `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` in commits. Otherwise, DCO is optional.
