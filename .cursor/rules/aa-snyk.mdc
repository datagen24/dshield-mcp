description: Use Snyk CLI for vulnerability scanning and security testing.
alwaysApply: true
---
- Run Snyk CLI vulnerability scans before deploying code changes.
- Execute `snyk test` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Use `snyk monitor` to continuously monitor projects for new vulnerabilities.
- Integrate Snyk testing into CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks.
- Address high-severity vulnerabilities promptly following Snyk recommendations.
- Keep dependencies updated based on Snyk security advisories.
- Run `snyk code test` for static application security testing (SAST).
- Generate and review Snyk test reports for security compliance.
 - CI must fail on High and Critical severity issues (block PR merges) unless explicitly and temporarily ignored with documented rationale.
 - Store Snyk reports under `artifacts/` for audit; schedule `snyk monitor` on a daily cadence.
 - Node/JS scanning is disabled for this repository; Python targets only.
