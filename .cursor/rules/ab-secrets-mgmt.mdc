description: Use 1Password CLI for secure secrets management.

- Store sensitive information and credentials using 1Password CLI (op).
- Access secrets programmatically using `op read` or `op inject` commands.
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials in code or configuration files.
- Use environment variables populated from 1Password for runtime configuration.
- Follow 1Password CLI best practices for authentication and session management.
 - Adopt a modular secrets handler with a provider interface (1Password today; pluggable providers in the future). Application code must remain provider-agnostic.
 - Do not persist secrets to disk; resolve at runtime; prefer short-lived tokens. Rotate secrets regularly.
 - Validate secrets backend availability at startup and fail fast with clear guidance if unavailable.
 - Standardize secret naming and locations (document vault/item paths); never log secret values.
 - In CI and local development, use environment variables to pass resolved secrets; never commit plaintext secrets.
