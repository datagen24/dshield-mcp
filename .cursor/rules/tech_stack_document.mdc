# Tech Stack Document for dshield-mcp

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices behind the `dsheild-mcp` (DShield Monitoring and Control Platform) project. It covers everything from how the system talks to users, to how it keeps data safe and fast.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

Although `dshield-mcp` is a backend service without a traditional web or mobile user interface, it still exposes a simple “front door” for users and other tools:

*   Command-line interaction (CLI)
*   MCP protocol over STDIO and TCP transports (JSON-RPC 2.0)

Key points:

*   There is no graphical web user interface—security analysts interact through terminal commands or via AI/automation clients. An optional Textual-based TUI is available for local monitoring and control.
*   Results come back as structured JSON or generated PDF reports, ready to view or plug into other systems.

## 2. Backend Technologies

All of the core work—connecting to data stores, crunching numbers, and generating reports—is done with Python and a set of supportive libraries:

**Programming Language**

*   Python 3.12+ (project target and CI target)

**MCP Server and Transports**

*   mcp (Python MCP server library) for STDIO transport
*   Custom TCP transport/server implementing JSON-RPC 2.0 with authentication and security

**HTTP Clients**

*   aiohttp and httpx (outgoing HTTP calls to external services like DShield API)

**Database & Search**

*   Elasticsearch / AsyncElasticsearch (stores and retrieves massive volumes of security events)

**Data Modeling & Validation**

*   Pydantic v2 (models and validation)
*   pydantic-settings (typed configuration management)

**Configuration & Secrets**

*   PyYAML + python-dotenv (load configuration from files and `.env`)
*   1Password CLI (`op`) (securely fetch API keys and credentials at runtime)

**Logging & Monitoring**

*   structlog (produces structured, machine-readable logs for troubleshooting and audit)

**Async & Utility Libraries**

*   asyncio (built-in Python support for async programming)
*   pathlib, tempfile, subprocess (file handling and external process calls)
*   datetime / python-dateutil (time handling and parsing)
*   dataclasses, typing, enum, collections.Counter (code clarity and data operations)

**Console UI (optional)**

*   Textual (TUI) for local monitoring and developer tooling

**Transport Defaults and Targets**

*   Default launch mode: STDIO (recommended for analyst workstations)
*   Advanced modes: TCP server and TUI
*   TCP deployment targets: macOS hosts and Red Hat UBI container (planned; container support to be finalized)

**Network & Analysis**

*   ipaddress (validates and works with IP ranges)
*   networkx (optional graph analysis for advanced correlation)
*   scikit-learn (optional clustering and pattern detection)

**Reporting Engine**

*   LaTeX (external distribution like TeX Live or MiKTeX to compile PDFs)
*   subprocess (runs the LaTeX compiler securely)

**Testing & Quality**

*   pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-cov + pytest-mock (unit and integration tests)
*   ruff (code linting and formatting)

**Documentation**

*   pdoc, pydoc-markdown (generate API docs from code comments)

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

How the platform is hosted, updated, and versioned:

*   Version Control: Git (hosted on GitHub)
*   CI/CD: GitHub Actions (runs tests, linting, security scans, and builds docs automatically on each commit)
*   Deployment: Runs on macOS or Linux servers/VMs with Python 3.12+, Elasticsearch access, and a LaTeX distribution installed
*   Containerization (optional): You can package the service in Docker for consistent environments, though it’s not required by the core system

These choices ensure:

*   **Reliability:** Automated tests and checks before deployment
*   **Scalability:** Easy to add servers or scale up based on load
*   **Reproducibility:** Consistent builds via GitHub Actions and container images (if used)

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

`dshield-mcp` works with several external services to enrich data and produce high-quality outputs:

*   **DShield API:** Fetches real-time threat intelligence (IP reputation, top attackers, attack summaries) with built-in caching and rate limiting
*   **Elasticsearch Cluster:** Primary store for all incoming security events, supporting smart pagination and aggregations
*   **1Password CLI:** Securely resolves `op://` URLs to pull secrets at runtime
*   **LaTeX Distribution:** Compiles generated reports into PDF format via subprocess calls

Each integration boosts the platform by automating data enrichment, handling large datasets, and ensuring secrets never appear in code or plain config files.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve put several layers in place to keep data safe and the system responsive:

**Security Measures**

*   No hard-coded secrets—everything comes from environment variables or the 1Password CLI
*   Input validation via Pydantic models to prevent injection attacks
*   Rate limiting and caching around DShield API calls to avoid external throttling
*   Structured logging with no sensitive data in logs (configured to stderr)
*   Access controls on MCP transports (STDIO and TCP) with API-key authentication and permissions on TCP
*   Security validation tools (`SecurityValidator` and `SecurityMonitor`) check for hidden instructions or anomalous tool usage

**Performance Optimizations**

*   Asynchronous I/O (`asyncio` + `aiohttp`) to handle many requests without blocking
*   Smart chunking and session-based streaming to process large Elasticsearch queries in manageable pieces
*   Query optimization (field selection, adjustable page sizes, fallback to aggregations) to minimize load and timeouts
*   In-memory caching for repeated threat intelligence lookups
*   Lightweight dependencies and focused modules to reduce startup time and memory footprint

Together, these measures aim for end-to-end campaign analysis in under 60 seconds on typical datasets while maintaining robust security.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

`dshield-mcp` brings together a modern, Python-centric toolkit to automate sophisticated security analysis in a DShield SIEM environment. Key highlights:

*   **Python 3.12+** with async support
*   **mcp (STDIO)** and a **custom TCP server** for JSON-RPC 2.0 transport
*   **AsyncElasticsearch** for fast, non-blocking ES operations
*   **Pydantic v2** and **pydantic-settings** for data validation and configuration
*   **structlog** for clear, structured logging (stderr)
*   **1Password CLI** for zero-trust secret handling
*   **Elasticsearch** as a scalable event store with smart query strategies
*   **LaTeX** for professional PDF reporting
*   **GitHub Actions** for automated testing, linting, and documentation
*   **Optional graph and ML libraries** (networkx, scikit-learn) and **Textual TUI** for local monitoring

This stack was chosen to balance **performance**, **security**, **extensibility**, and **ease of use**—giving security analysts a powerful backend service that integrates seamlessly with their existing workflows and infrastructure.
