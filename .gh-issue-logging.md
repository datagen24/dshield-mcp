Summary:
Implement configurable file-based logging with rotation while preserving MCP protocol constraints (stdout reserved for JSON-RPC; logs to stderr and file). Update docs to reflect configuration and usage.

Motivation:
- User requires dedicated log file, configurable via user settings.
- Maintain compliance: never log to stdout; keep JSON-RPC on stdout.

Proposed changes:
- Add user_config.logging options: log_file_path, log_rotate, max_bytes, backup_count.
- Initialize structlog to log to stderr and to configured file handler.
- Ensure TUI and TCP transports also respect file logging.
- Add examples to user_config.example.yaml.
- Update README/docs for setup and troubleshooting.

Tasks:
- [ ] Add logging file configuration keys and validation
- [ ] Wire file handler in logging initialization
- [ ] Ensure no stdout leakage (tests)
- [ ] Update docs/README and root README
- [ ] Add tests for rotation/permissions

Acceptance criteria:
- Logs written to configured file with rotation
- No logs on stdout; protocol unaffected
- Docs show clear configuration and examples
