Title: Audit code vs. documentation for system accuracy (tech-debt)

Summary:
Perform a cross-cutting audit to ensure code and documentation reflect actual systems and behavior. Track mismatches and propose fixes.

Scope:
- Transport layers and defaults (STDIO primary, TCP/TUI advanced)
- Python target version (3.12) across code, configs, docs
- HTTP clients (aiohttp vs httpx) usage consistency
- Logging behavior (stderr + file, no stdout)
- Naming consistency (fix 'dsheild' -> 'dshield')
- Configuration keys present in code vs documented

Tasks:
- [ ] Inventory transports, defaults, and config flags
- [ ] Validate Python version references/code constraints
- [ ] Confirm HTTP client usage and update docs accordingly
- [ ] Verify logging pathways and test for stdout leakage
- [ ] Run project-wide spelling check and fix references
- [ ] Compile a remediation plan with owner and estimates

Acceptance Criteria:
- Documented list of mismatches with recommended actions
- Follow-up issues created for each actionable change
- Docs updated where mismatches are purely documentation

Label: tech-debt
