# Dev Tools Migration Plan

This document outlines the iterative plan to migrate development tools tests from the `dev_tools/` directory into the formal pytest test suite in `tests/`.

## Overview

The `dev_tools/` directory contains 25+ test scripts that were created during development for debugging and feature validation. These scripts need to be migrated to the formal pytest suite to:

- Ensure consistent test patterns and mocking
- Enable CI/CD integration
- Provide better test isolation and reliability
- Standardize test reporting and coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### **High-Risk Areas:**
1. **Campaign Analysis Tests** - Complex integration, may need significant refactoring
2. **Pagination Tests** - Multiple variations, need careful consolidation
3. **Real Data Dependencies** - Some tests may rely on specific data that needs mocking

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Start with simple tests** to establish patterns
2. **Use comprehensive mocking** to avoid external dependencies
3. **Create mock data fixtures** for complex scenarios
4. **Test incrementally** - one phase at a time
5. **Maintain existing dev_tools** until migration is complete

## Completion Criteria

The migration is complete when:
- [x] All appropriate dev_tools tests are migrated to pytest
- [x] All new tests pass consistently
- [x] Existing test suite continues to pass
- [x] Debug tools remain available for development
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] CI/CD pipeline includes all new tests

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All phases of the dev_tools migration have been successfully completed:

- **Phase 1**: Data Dictionary and 1Password Integration ✅
- **Phase 2**: Core Functionality ✅
- **Phase 3**: Feature Tests ✅
- **Phase 4**: Advanced Feature Tests ✅
- **Phase 5**: Complex Integration Tests ✅
- **Phase 6**: Debug & Utility Tests ✅

**Total Tests Migrated**: 183 tests across 10 test files
**Debug Tools Preserved**: 4 debug/utility scripts remain in dev_tools/
**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all major functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1.1**: Migrate data dictionary tests
2. **Establish patterns**: Use as template for subsequent phases
3. **Iterate through phases**: One phase per week
4. **Validate progress**: Ensure no regressions at each phase
5. **Update documentation**: Keep this plan current with progress
