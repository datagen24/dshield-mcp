#11 - Campaign Analysis ⭐⭐⭐
Priority: HIGHEST for Phase 2

Perfect Test Case: Use the 141.98.80.135 campaign we analyzed
Foundation Ready: Your pagination + chunking + performance metrics = perfect base
Strategic Value: Transforms individual events into campaign intelligence
User Impact: Showcase the full power of your platform

Perfect Real-World Validation:
Use the 141.98.80.135 campaign as your primary test case:

10,000+ events - Tests your pagination scaling
Multi-day timeline - Tests temporal analysis
Clear attack patterns - Validates pattern recognition
Known infrastructure - Tests attribution features

Suggested Technical Architecture:
`def analyze_attack_campaign(seed_ip, time_window_hours=48):
# Leverage your existing pagination for data gathering
events = query_dshield_events(
filters={"source.ip": seed_ip},
time_range_hours=time_window_hours,
page_size=100 # Your pagination handles scale perfectly
)

# Use your performance metrics for optimization visibility
with QueryMetrics() as metrics:
    campaign_analysis = {
        "campaign_overview": {
            "total_events": metrics.result_count,
            "time_span": calculate_time_span(events),
            "attack_intensity": calculate_intensity(events)
        },
        "attack_timeline": build_timeline(events),  # Use your chunking
        "target_analysis": analyze_targets(events),
        "ttp_analysis": extract_ttps(events),
        "infrastructure_map": map_infrastructure(events),
        "threat_assessment": assess_threat_level(events)
    }

return {
    "campaign_analysis": campaign_analysis,
    "performance_metrics": metrics.finalize()  # Your metrics integration
}`
Integration Opportunities:
`# Campaign Analysis + Performance Metrics
campaign_result = analyze_campaign(ip="141.98.80.135")

Returns: campaign data + performance metrics + optimization details

Campaign Analysis + Smart Chunking

campaign_timeline = get_campaign_timeline(
campaign_id="campaign_141_98_80_135",
chunk_by="daily_phases" # Your chunking logic
)

Campaign Analysis + Dynamic Configuration

campaign_config = {

## 🎯 Implementation Plan Complete - Campaign Analysis

I've completed a comprehensive implementation plan for **Issue #11: Campaign Analysis**. This critical security feature will enable correlation and analysis of coordinated attack campaigns across time and multiple indicators - essential for understanding sophisticated threat actor operations and APTs.

### 📋 **Implementation Overview**

**Scope**: Full campaign correlation and analysis engine
**Integration**: 7 new MCP tools for campaign investigation

### 🎯 **Key Features Planned**

#### Phase 1: Core Campaign Engine (Weeks 1-2)

- ✅ **Correlation Strategies** - IP-based, infrastructure, behavioral, temporal, geospatial
- ✅ **Campaign Data Models** - Campaign, CampaignEvent, and IndicatorRelationship classes
- ✅ **IOC Expansion** - Discover related indicators from seed events

#### Phase 2: MCP Integration & Tools (Week 2)
- ✅ `analyze_campaign` - Analyze attack campaigns from seed indicators
- ✅ `expand_campaign_indicators` - Expand IOCs to find related indicators
- ✅ `get_campaign_timeline` - Build detailed attack timelines
- ✅ `compare_campaigns` - Compare multiple campaigns for similarities
- ✅ `detect_ongoing_campaigns` - Real-time detection of active campaigns
- ✅ `search_campaigns` - Search existing campaigns by criteria
- ✅ `get_campaign_details` - Comprehensive campaign information

#### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis (Week 3)
- ✅ **Pattern Recognition** - TTP detection, tool recognition, infrastructure patterns
- ✅ **Threat Actor Attribution** - Campaign attribution and threat actor profiling
- ✅ **Campaign Visualization** - Timeline, network graph, geographic map data

#### Phase 4: Integration & Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
- ✅ **Enhanced Elasticsearch Queries** - Specialized correlation queries
- ✅ **Campaign Persistence** - Storage and version control
- ✅ **Performance Optimization** - Caching, indexing, parallel processing

### 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

#### Core Campaign Analysis Engine:
```python
class CampaignAnalyzer:
    """Core campaign analysis and correlation engine"""

    def correlate_events(self, seed_events, correlation_criteria, time_window):
        """Correlate events based on specified criteria"""

    def expand_indicators(self, seed_iocs, expansion_strategy):
        """Expand IOCs to find related indicators"""

    def build_campaign_timeline(self, correlated_events):
        """Build chronological timeline of campaign events"""

    def score_campaign(self, campaign_data):
        """Score campaign based on sophistication and impact"""
```

#### Multi-Stage Correlation Algorithm:
```python
def correlate_campaign_events(seed_events, correlation_config):
    # Stage 1: Direct IOC matches
    # Stage 2: Infrastructure correlation
    # Stage 3: Behavioral correlation
    # Stage 4: Temporal correlation
    # Stage 5: Confidence scoring and filtering
```

#### Campaign Data Models:
```python
@dataclass
class Campaign:
    campaign_id: str
    confidence_score: float
    start_time: datetime
    end_time: datetime
    attack_vectors: List[str]
    related_indicators: List[str]
    suspected_actor: Optional[str]
```

### 🎯 **Correlation Capabilities**

**Correlation Methods:**
- **IP-based**: Same source IPs, IP ranges, ASNs
- **Infrastructure**: Shared domains, certificates, hosting
- **Behavioral**: Similar attack patterns, timing, TTPs
- **Temporal**: Time-based clustering and proximity
- **Geospatial**: Geographic correlation of attacks
- **Signature-based**: Malware families, tools, techniques

### 📊 **Usage Scenarios**

#### Scenario 1: Investigating Suspicious IP
```python
campaign = analyze_campaign(
    seed_indicators=["192.168.1.100"],
    time_range_hours=168,  # 1 week
    correlation_methods=["ip_correlation", "temporal_correlation"],
    min_confidence=0.7
)
# Results: Coordinated campaign with 50+ related IPs across 3 weeks
```

#### Scenario 2: IOC Expansion
```python
expanded_campaign = expand_campaign_indicators(
    campaign_id="campaign_abc123",
    expansion_depth=3,
    include_passive_dns=True
)
# Discovers: Related C2 infrastructure and additional malware samples
```

#### Scenario 3: Ongoing Campaign Detection
```python
ongoing_campaigns = detect_ongoing_campaigns(
    time_window_hours=24,
    min_event_threshold=15,
    correlation_threshold=0.8
)
# Identifies: 2 active campaigns requiring immediate attention
```

### 📁 **File Structure**
**New Files**: 17 files across `src/`, `tests/`, `examples/`, and `docs/`
