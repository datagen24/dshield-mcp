# Graceful Degradation Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing graceful degradation in the DShield MCP server to ensure full compliance with the MCP protocol spec. The goal is to make the server resilient to dependency failures while maintaining functionality where possible.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Already Implemented ✅
1. **Basic Structure**: Health check manager, feature manager, and dynamic tool registry classes exist
2. **Placeholder Methods**: Basic health check methods are in place but return hardcoded values
3. **Tool Availability Checking**: Basic tool availability checking exists in the MCP server
4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for unavailable tools exists

### What's Missing
1. **Real Health Checks**: Actual connectivity and health verification for dependencies
2. **Feature Flag Integration**: Proper integration between health checks and feature availability
3. **Dynamic Tool Registration**: Tools should only be registered if their dependencies are healthy
4. **Fallback Behavior**: Alternative functionality when primary dependencies are unavailable
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of health status and degradation decisions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Current Code Issues (Priority: HIGH) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Restore the codebase to a working state before implementing new features

## Implementation Details

### Health Check Manager Enhancements ✅

```python
class HealthCheckManager:
    async def check_elasticsearch(self) -> bool:
        """Real Elasticsearch health check"""
        try:
            # Test connection
            # Check cluster health
            # Verify index access
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Elasticsearch health check failed", error=str(e))
            return False
    
    async def check_dshield_api(self) -> bool:
        """Real DShield API health check"""
        try:
            # Test connectivity
            # Verify authentication
            # Check endpoint availability
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("DShield API health check failed", error=str(e))
            return False
```

### Feature Manager Integration ✅

```python
class FeatureManager:
    async def initialize_features(self) -> None:
        """Initialize features based on health status"""
        health_status = self.health_manager.health_status
        
        for feature, dependencies in FEATURE_DEPENDENCIES.items():
            if not dependencies:
                self.features[feature] = True  # No dependencies
            else:
                # Check if all dependencies are healthy
                self.features[feature] = all(
                    health_status.get(dep, False) for dep in dependencies
                )
```

### Dynamic Tool Registration ✅

```python
class DynamicToolRegistry:
    def register_tools(self, all_tools: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        """Register only available tools"""
        available_tools = []
        
        for tool_name in all_tools:
            feature = TOOL_FEATURE_MAPPING.get(tool_name, 'unknown')
            
            if feature == 'unknown' or self.feature_manager.is_feature_available(feature):
                available_tools.append(tool_name)
                self.tool_details[tool_name] = {
                    "available": True,
                    "feature": feature,
                    "reason": "Feature available"
                }
            else:
                self.tool_details[tool_name] = {
                    "available": False,
                    "feature": feature,
                    "reason": f"Feature '{feature}' unavailable"
                }
        
        return available_tools
