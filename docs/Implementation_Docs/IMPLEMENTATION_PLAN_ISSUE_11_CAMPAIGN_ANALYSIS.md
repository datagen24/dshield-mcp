# Implementation Plan for Issue #11: Campaign Analysis

## Project: dshield-mcp
## Issue: #11 - Campaign Analysis
## Status: Ready for Implementation
## Estimated Timeline: 3-4 weeks

---

## Overview

This implementation plan addresses **Issue #11: Campaign Analysis**, a critical security feature that will enable correlation and analysis of coordinated attack campaigns across time and multiple indicators. This capability is essential for understanding sophisticated threat actor operations and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

## Background

Campaign Analysis is crucial for modern cybersecurity operations because:

- **Threat Actor Attribution**: Identify coordinated attacks from the same threat actors
- **Attack Timeline Reconstruction**: Understand the full scope and timeline of campaigns
- **IOC Expansion**: Discover related indicators and infrastructure
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify attack techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs)
- **Threat Intelligence**: Generate actionable intelligence from campaign data

Based on the DShield MCP project's current capabilities, this feature will leverage existing Elasticsearch infrastructure and enhance it with campaign correlation logic.

## Campaign Analysis Requirements

### Core Capabilities
1. **Event Correlation**: Link related security events across time
2. **IOC Expansion**: Discover related indicators from seed events
3. **Timeline Analysis**: Reconstruct attack timelines and phases
4. **Pattern Detection**: Identify common TTPs and attack patterns
5. **Campaign Scoring**: Assess campaign sophistication and impact
6. **Threat Attribution**: Group campaigns by likely threat actors

### Technical Requirements
- Correlation across multiple time windows (hours to months)
- Support for various correlation criteria (IPs, domains, hashes, etc.)
- Scalable processing for large event datasets
- Real-time and historical analysis capabilities
- Export capabilities for threat intelligence platforms
